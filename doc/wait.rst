|wait|
======

This can be used to wait for some time, see e.g. :scene-link:`wait.asd`:

.. literalinclude:: scenes/wait.asd

``dur``
-------

The wait duration can be given either as a time duration or
as a percentage of the parent duration.
The same syntax as in the :ref:`transform-time` attribute
of transform nodes is supported.
